# list_app
The app was created for list users who need a simple list to keep track of.  The user will need access to database to store data in the phone and sms permission to notify when an item is running low and/or out of stock.
The first screen starts off with a login screen to have the user log in and use their database.  My UI design kept users in mind by keeping it as simple as possible and having all the buttons at users reach so that it will not be hard to understand how to use it.
I approach the process of coding my app by finding out what the users that need a list actually need in order to process the data.  My technique was to capture the data, and store it in the phone along with the quantity that way the user can return to it at a later time.  The process was important because if we did not save the information in a database, it will be lost everytime the user exits the app rendering it userless.
I tested the code statically and dynamically to make sure it is running to minimize errors making the app crash.
Overall I believe I did an okay job.  I could have done a better job if I had more time to focus on the app.  There are alot of things that I learned thru the process in creating this app and I would like to apply them in the later future.
